# Disaster-Response-Pipelines
In this project, we have a data set containing real messages that were sent during disaster events. We will be creating a machine learning pipeline to classify these events to send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data. This project will show off your software skills, including your ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!

Below is an screenshots of the web app.
